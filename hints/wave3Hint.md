Using a stack in a manner similar to the solution for [this NeetCode problem](https://neetcode.io/problems/validate-parentheses) may be helpful. Your creation of the Map to return will look completely different and you'll need to keep track of locations (your Stack will likely hold Integers), but the overall idea is similar. Focus on how the NeetCode solution uses the Stack, NOT on how it uses its Map.
